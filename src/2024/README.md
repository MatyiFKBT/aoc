| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)   | Fairly simple task to iterate over two lists. Used a bit of regex in my solution, will try to learn more of that during the month.  |
| [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)   | Bunch of array methods. Used array.filter, array.every, array.splice and array.shift. ---                                           |
| [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/3)   | Regex time! I might have to look into `input.matchAll`... the second part was a bit tricky this way with a loop.                    |
| [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4)   | Array of arrays, and using different directions to find letters in the whole grid.                                                  |
| [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/5)   | Splitting the input into two parts, iterating through them, applying filters and in part2 I used Sets too to fix _invalid updates_. |
| [Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6)   | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/7)   | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/8)   | It took a bit to understand the task, after that it was "just" working with the grid to find all _antinodes_                        |
| [Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/9)   | Part 1 was easy, Part 2 (defragmentation) took a long time to calculate.                                                            |
| [Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/10) | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| [Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/11) | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| [Day 12](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/12) | ---                                                                                                                                 |
| [Day 13](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/13) | Had to look for a shortest path for the first part, and calculate scores in the second one.                                         |
| [Day 14](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/14) | ---                                                                                                                                 |
