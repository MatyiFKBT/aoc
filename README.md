# My Advent Of Code solutions

This repository stores all my [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions. For the last years, I have been solving the puzzles with TypeScript.

You can check out 2024's solutions in the [2024](./src/2024) directory.

## Requirements

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) v2.1.3+


```bash
# getting the input
deno task prep [year] [day] [part] # defaults to the current day, and part 1

# submitting the solution
deno task solve [year] [day] [part]
# defaults to the current day and the most recently edited part
```

> [!NOTE]
> For 2024, I used utilities from this repository to programatically download the input and upload the solution: <https://github.com/MauritsWilke/AdventOfCode>
